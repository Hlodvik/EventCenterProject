I left plenty of comments explaining my thinking and methods, but as a general overview:

I had a bit too much fun imagining this pretend venue. Gymir's Hall is the name of the building, it holds a restaurant called Hymir's Table, a bar called Suttung's Cellar, a concert hall, an exibit hall, and apartments on upper levels. The website holds a separate section for events, for the restaurant, and for the bar. The event inquiry form is actually linked to a google form (something I'm kind of proud of for making functional) and the responses are actually saved and viewable by me. Same with the contact us form. I had to get a fair bit of help figuring out how to setup the interface between my code and the google forms, but it really wasn't too much extra work.

I wanted to be able to load the script form the JSON, felt far more realistic. this caused some issues though so while testing the website please be sure to use python's built in server. (python -m http.server 8000)


I really really wanted this website to look polished so I used some javascript. Even though I was fully aware that the next module is on javascript, I already know a fair deal of js and the website just didn't feel complete without some. This ended up making this project take several days longer than it needed to which is regrettable, but I'm still happy with the results. 

I am almost positive there are some vestigial css classes. I did my best to clean it up, but there are possibly more classes in the css than are actually used.

I used all sorts of content I found online, changing things up just a tiny bit to make it feel immersive //not ripped off of other peoples hard work. (just the content for the menus, drinks, about us section etc etc, not the actual code) 

thanks and shout outs to:
    the Black Pearl in Reykjavic, the location I used, as well as a picture of the outside for the background of the contact us page
    Williams & Graham in Denver, The signature cocktails mostly came from here, though I changed all the names
    Bandsintown.com, I modeled my events page after theirs
    Denver comedy Lounge for the saturday night standup poster I used
    Cellar Bar in NY which is permanently closed but still wanted to mention
